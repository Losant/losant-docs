If you want to get on-boarded with Losant as quickly as possible, youâ€™re in the right place. Losant University takes you through the ins-and-outs of the platform so you can start building IoT applications in no time.

The Losant platform is separated into components:

- Data and Device Management
- Data Visualization
- Visual Workflow Engine
- End-User Experiences
- Edge Computing

The courses in Losant University break down and explain each of the Losant components. Once done with the courses, you will have a full understanding of the platform and be a Losant Expert. Once you are a Losant Expert, you will be able to build any IoT application using Losant with ease.

Below you can find all the available courses. **It is recommended that you follow along in order because the videos build upon one another.** All the workshops are located here in the Losant Documentation.

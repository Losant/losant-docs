# HTTP Node

The HTTP node allows a workflow to make an arbitrary HTTP request and optionally place the response on the current payload.

## Configuration

The Output HTTP node is configured in the same way as the [Data HTTP node](/workflows/data/http/). The node is available under both the Data and Outputs sections purely for organizational purposes.

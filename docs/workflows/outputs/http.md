# HTTP Node

The HTTP Node allows a workflow to make an arbitrary HTTP request and optionally place the response on the current payload.

![HTTP Node](/images/workflows/outputs/http-node.png "HTTP Node")

## Configuration

The Output HTTP Node is configured in the same way as the [Data HTTP Node](/workflows/data/http/). The node is available under both the Data and Outputs sections purely for organizational purposes.

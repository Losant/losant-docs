# Device: Disconnect Trigger

The Device: Disconnect Trigger will trigger a workflow whenever one or more devices disconnect from the Losant Platform, via the MQTT broker or the REST API.

## Configuration

The Device: Disconnect Trigger can be configured with one or more specific devices, or a selection of tags (or both). When a device that matches anything in the selection disconnects from Losant, the workflow will trigger. See the [device query](/devices/device-queries/) documentation for more info about how ID and tag matching works.

In the above example, the workflow will be triggered whenever any device that has a `location` tag disconnects from Losant.

## Payload

The payload will have various information on the data field about the connection that was terminated. In the general case, a device disconnect workflow payload will look like the following:

```json
{
  "time": <time of disconnect>,
  "data": {
    "disconnectReason": <a reason for the disconnection>,
    "messagesFromDevice": <count of messages sent from device while connected>,
    "messagesToDevice": <count of messages sent to device while connected>,
    "connectedAt": <time when connection was originally established>
  },
  "applicationId": <id of the current application>,
  "applicationName": <name of the current application>,
  "triggerId": <id of the triggering device>,
  "triggerType": "deviceIdDisconnect",
  "deviceTags": {<any tags for the device>},
  "deviceName": <the device name>,
  "flowId": <id of the current workflow>,
  "flowName": <name of the current workflow>,
  "globals": <object of workflow globals>
}
```

For the example workflow above, a specific payload for a triggered workflow might look like this:

```json
{
  "time": Fri Feb 19 2016 17:26:00 GMT-0500 (EST),
  "data": {
    "disconnectReason": "Connection Lost",
    "messagesFromDevice": 1385,
    "messagesToDevice": 0,
    "connectedAt": Fri Feb 19 2016 16:25:00 GMT-0500 (EST)
  },
  "applicationId": "568beedeb436ab01007be53d",
  "applicationName": "Embree",
  "triggerId": "56c8967bb8df0f0100d629120",
  "triggerType": "deviceIdDisconnect",
  "deviceTags": {
    "floor": ["2"],
    "location": ["warehouse1"]
  },
  "deviceName": "My Factory Device",
  "flowId": "56c74add04d0b50100043381",
  "flowName": "Connection Info",

}
```

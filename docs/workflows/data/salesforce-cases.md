# Salesforce Cases

The Salesforce Cases Node allows Losant workflows to access the [Salesforce Service Cloud](https://www.salesforce.com/products/service-cloud/overview/) and create, read, update or delete cases in their CRM platform.

## Configuration

There are three main configuration sections for the Salesforce Cases Node ...

### Authentication

Most people choose to store these three values in their [workflow globals](/workflows/overview/#workflow-globals). All three fields accept [string templates](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates).

![Salesforce Credentials](/images/workflows/data/salesforce-credentials.png "Salesforce Credentials")

* **Salesforce Username**: Required. This is your username for authenticating against the Salesforce API.
* **Salesforce Password**: Required. This is your password for authenticating against the Salesforce API.
* **Security Token**: This may be required depending on your Salesforce account settings. [Read more about security tokens](https://developer.salesforce.com/forums?id=906F00000009B2zIAE).

### Case Action Configuration

Before filling out the rest of this section, users must first choose a **Salesforce Case Action**. Depending on the selected value, a number of other fields are presented. Each field accepts a static value or a [string template](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates).

### Storing The Response

![Salesforce Result](/images/workflows/data/salesforce-result.png "Salesforce Result")

 If a path is defined, the Salesforce Case Node will store the response from the request at the defined [payload path](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#payload-path).

 Depending on the type of request made, the response from Salesforce can take a few different forms. Here is an example of the most complicated response object: an array of results returned from a query (only one item is included here) ...

```json
 {
   "errors": [],
   "items": [
     {
       "attributes": {
         "type": "Case",
         "url": "/services/data/v37.0/sobjects/Case/500410000021Zt4AAE"
       },
       "Id": "500410000021Zt4AAE",
       "IsDeleted": false,
       "CaseNumber": "00001002",
       "ContactId": "003410000052pXCAAY",
       "AccountId": "00141000005JEI8AAO",
       "AssetId": null,
       "ParentId": null,
       "SuppliedName": null,
       "SuppliedEmail": null,
       "SuppliedPhone": null,
       "SuppliedCompany": null,
       "Type": "Electrical",
       "Status": "New",
       "Reason": "Installation",
       "Origin": "Web",
       "Subject": "Seeking guidance on electrical wiring installation for GC5060",
       "Priority": "Low",
       "Description": null,
       "IsClosed": false,
       "ClosedDate": null,
       "IsEscalated": false,
       "OwnerId": "00541000000KCeFAAW",
       "CreatedDate": "2016-09-27T20:32:11.000+0000",
       "CreatedById": "00541000000KCeFAAW",
       "LastModifiedDate": "2016-09-27T20:32:11.000+0000",
       "LastModifiedById": "00541000000KCeFAAW",
       "SystemModstamp": "2016-09-27T20:32:11.000+0000",
       "LastViewedDate": null,
       "LastReferencedDate": null,
       "EngineeringReqNumber__c": null,
       "SLAViolation__c": "No",
       "Product__c": "GC3060",
       "PotentialLiability__c": "No"
     }
   ],
   "success": true
  }
```

If there is an error in your request, the Salesforce API will return an appropriate error message. For example ...

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "errors": [
    "Error: INVALID_LOGIN: Invalid username, password, security token; or user locked out."
  ]
}
```

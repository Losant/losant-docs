# Random Number Node

The Random Number Node generates a random integer within a range of your choosing.

## Configuration

The node takes three parameters, all of which are required.

**Minimum Value** and **Maximum Value** are each a number or a [string template](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates) resolving to a numerical value on your payload. The randomly generated number is **inclusive** of the defined minimum and maximum values; for example, if `0` is set as the minimum value, then `0` is a possible output from the node.

The **Result Path** is a [payload path](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#payload-paths) stipulating where on the payload the resulting number should be stored.

## Node Failure Cases

If the node fails to generate a random number, the result stored on the payload at the result path will be `null`. There are a few of cases where this could occur, most likely when using a string template to reference a value within the payload:

* **The minimum or maximum value is not a number.** The node attempts to type the value to a number (for example, a string of `"1"` will type to the number `1`) but if that fails, the number generator will return `null`.
* **The minimum value is greater than the maximum value.** It is, of course, impossible to find a random number in that case.
* **There are no integers between the minimum and maximum values.** For example, if a minimum value of `1.3` and a maximum value of `1.9` are passed, the node will return `null` because there is no possible random integer between the two values.

# User Accounts

Users are the highest level resource in Losant. All applications and dashboards are either owned by a user or by an organization (of which users can be members). You can sign up as a new user on the <a href="https://accounts.losant.com/create-account" target="\_blank">create account page</a>.

## User Profile

Your user profile stores information like your name and email address. To view and edit this information, click your user icon on the bottom left of the screen and select `Settings` under `My Account`. You will be redirected to the `Profile` tab.

## Password

You can change your password at any time on the `Password` tab. You will need to provide your current password and the new password. If you forgot your password and cannot login, navigate to the <a href="https://accounts.losant.com/forgot-password" target="\_blank">forgot password page</a>.

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Losant's two-factor authentication protects your account against unauthorized access even in the event your password has been compromised.

To use Losant's two-factor authentication you must have a mobile/desktop application that supports the open [TOTP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238) standard. Google Authenticator is available for both [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2 "Google Authenticator - Android") and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8 "Google Authenticator - iOS"). Another excellent application for managing TOTP accounts is [Authy](https://www.authy.com/app/) which has both mobile and desktop clients.

### Enabling Two-Factor Authentication

Navigate to the `Two-Factor Auth`, and the click the `Enable Two-Factor Authentication ...` button.

Use your favorite 2FA app like Google Authenticator to scan the QR code. The app will then start generating short-lived, one-time use codes. Type the code displayed within your app into the `Two-Factor Code` field in your Losant account settings. Enter your Losant password and click `Enable Two Factor Auth`. If the code expires before you click the button, you will have to enter the new code displayed within your app.

### Signing In with Two-Factor Authentication

Open the two-factor authentication app used in the verification process and select the Losant account. Enter the generated one-time use code into the `Two Factor Code` field along with your username and password.

## Linked Accounts

Losant allows users to connect third-party accounts for use within the Losant Platform.

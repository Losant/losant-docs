# Section Header

The Section Header Block allows you to add a dividing header and descriptive content relevant to a section on your dashboard.

## Configuration

The block has two configurable options - the title and the content. Unlike a normal dashboard block, the provided title text is displayed as a section header. Any provided content is displayed underneath the section header. The title and content also support <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="\_blank">Markdown</a>, meaning that links, text formatting and even images can also be displayed within the Section Header bock.

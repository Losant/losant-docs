# GPS Heatmap

The GPS Heatmap Block shows the distribution of GPS datapoints across one or more devices. The heatmap can show historical information or the current position distribution for a set of devices.

The map will automatically pan and zoom to display all the available data retrieved for the block's configuration. However, you are free to pan and zoom the map on your own.

## Configuration

At least one device ID or tag must be specified, along with a duration.

### Duration

![GPS Heatmap Duration](/images/dashboards/heatmap-duration.png "GPS Heatmap Duration")

To view the current location of your devices, select "Last received data point". This will show your devices on the map as red dots.

To view your devices' locations over a given period of time, choose any other value for duration. This will alter the map to show where your devices have been, as a percentage of time, over the given duration. The hotter the color (red and orange), the more time your device has spent in that location over the selected duration. Cooler colors (blue, purple) show places your device has been for some time in the given duration, but for a lesser percentage of time than the hotter areas.

### Block Data

The physical location of one or multiple devices can be viewed on the GPS Heatmap. At least one device ID or device tag is required to create the map, and devices are chosen in the form of a [device query](/devices/device-queries/).

![GPS Heatmap Attribute](/images/dashboards/heatmap-attribute.png "GPS Heatmap Attribute")

The selected device(s) must return an attribute of the type [GPS string](/devices/state/#gps-attributes). In the **Attribute** dropdown, select the attribute's name to display on the graph. Note that, when displaying multiple devices on the heatmap, each device must return data under the same attribute name, and any device attributes that are not of the [GPS string](/devices/state/#gps-attributes) type will not be available to choose.

### Default Viewport

Set the default viewport for the block. You can also interact with the map in the block preview and pass its settings to the block configuration by clicking the "Set" button.

* **Center:** Automatically center the map to the middle of the points returned by the query, or set a manual position for the chart's center either as a context variable or in a `lat,lng` format.
* **Zoom:** Automatically zoom the map to display all points returned by the query, or set a manual zoom level.
* **Bearing:** Set a default bearing, where `0` points north to the top of the map, and values between `-180` and `180` swing the map in either direction.
* **Pitch:** Set a default pitch for the map, between `0` (straight overhead) and `60` degrees.

Once a user manually pans or zooms the chart in the dashboard view, the default settings are disregarded until the dashboard is reloaded.

### Map Style

![GPS History Map Style](/images/dashboards/map-style.png "GPS History Map Style")

Optionally, you may choose a particular map style. The two current styles available are `Normal` and `Satellite`. Normal is a standard vector map with streets and labels, and will change from a light to a dark style depending on the theme chosen for viewing the dashboard. Satellite uses satellite imagery to display the map with streets and labels overlaid on top - the satellite style does not have themes for light or dark, and will remain the same no matter what theme is chosen for the dashboard.

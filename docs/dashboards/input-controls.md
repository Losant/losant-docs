# Input Controls

The Input Controls Block allows you to send commands to devices, or to trigger workflows, directly from a dashboard. The block includes various input components to allow for configuring the payloads sent with those commands or triggers, and those components can also be configured to show the current state of your devices.

## Adding and Removing Controls

From the block's edit screen, controls can be added by clicking the "Add Controls" button at the bottom of the configuration panel. This will open a drop-down menu containing all of the available input types. On selection of a control type, a new configuration panel will appear for that input.

![Add Input Control](/images/dashboards/input-controls-add.png "Add Input Control")

Controls can be removed from the edit screen by clicking the trashcan icon at the right side of the control's configuration panel.

## Rearranging and Resizing Controls

On the edit screen, all controls can be resized and rearranged within the input control block. To move a control, simply click and drag the input to a new location. To resize an input, click and hold the handle in the bottom right corner of the control and drag the control to its new width.

## Control Configuration

The block supports inputs of four types, plus a special ["Help Block" component](#help-blocks). The four inputs share a few common attributes:

* **Label**: All controls require a label attribute.
* **Color**: Controls other than text inputs can optionally be given a custom color.
* **Template ID:** Controls other than buttons are automatically assigned a Template ID, which can be used when constructing your command / workflow payloads. You may change this ID if you wish.
* **Default Value:** Controls other than buttons all get a default value, and optionally, each control can have its default value set by a device data query.

### Dynamic Default Values

By setting dynamic default values for your controls, you can extend the functionality of the Input Controls Block to also serve as a series of simple gauges reflecting the last recorded state of your devices. When the block is "locked" (the lock/unlock option in the block settings menu), each of the controls that has a dynamic default set will update with a new value every time your dashboard refreshes.

![Input Controls Dynamic Default](/images/dashboards/input-controls-dynamic-default.png "Input Controls Dynamic Default")

Any control that has a dynamic default set is marked with an icon in the control's label. Any control whose query fails to return a result, or if the result cannot be cast to a value the input can display (such as a string being applied to a range input), will be indicated with a red icon. That input's default will fall back to the static value.

When setting a **dynamic default value**, you must define the following values for your data query:

* **Device IDs / Tags**: A list of devices and/or tags to query for state data.
* **Attribute**: The attribute whose last reported value should be returned.
* **Aggregation**: If necessary (such as when two or more devices or at least one device tag is selected), the method by which the multiple results returned by the query should be reduced to a single value.

### Range Sliders

Range sliders allow for the setting of **number** values. When configuring the input, it is necessary to define the range's minimum, maximum and default values, as well as the step size (the size of each "tick" in the range slider).

![Range Input](/images/dashboards/input-controls-range-input.png "Range Input")

From the dashboard, the input's knob can be dragged left or right to set the numerical value to be sent in the payload. The area to the left of the knob will appear in the color selected during configuration.

### Toggle Switches

Toggle switches allow for the setting of **boolean** values (true or false). The default value must be set.

![Toggle Input](/images/dashboards/input-controls-toggle-input.png "Toggle Input")

From the dashboard, the toggle can be flipped between the two values. When set to **true**, the toggle's background will match the color chosen for it during configuration.

### Text Inputs

Text inputs allow for the setting of arbitrary values, usually as a **string**. The control may be left empty by default if desired.

![Text Input](/images/dashboards/input-controls-text-input.png "Text Input")

From the dashboard, enter some text within the text input field to use within your payload or command name.

### Dropdown Selectors

Dropdowns allow for setting text values in your payload, but unlike a text input, the user's options are limited to an array of values specified in the block. When configuring the block, you may choose "no value" as the default, or you may choose one of your configured options.

![Dropdown](/images/dashboards/input-controls-dropdown.png "Dropdown")

For each option, a "value" is required; this is the actual value that will be rendered out in your payload. You may optionally set a label for each value, which reflects how that value will be depicted in the dropdown. If no label is set, the option's value will serve as the label.

If the dropdown's value is set by a [dynamic default](#dynamic-default-values), and the current value is not one of your configured options, the option will automatically be added to the dropdown and will be selected by default.

### Button Triggers

Buttons are responsible for triggering device commands or workflows when clicked. Without a button, it is impossible to send commands or trigger workflows; so, unless you are simply using an Input Controls Block to display device state within the other controls, make sure your block has at least one button within it.

![Button Trigger](/images/dashboards/input-controls-send-command.png "Button Trigger")

If you'd like your button press to trigger a [device command](/devices/commands/), select the **Send Device Command** radio button. This will display two required input fields:

* **Device IDs / Tags**: A [device query](/devices/device-queries/) for which device(s) should receive the command. Note that the only available devices are the ones within the block's currently selected application.
* **Command Name**: The command that should be sent to the device(s). The field may be set with a static value (e.g. `setColor`), or with a Mustache-wrapped Template ID for a text input (e.g. `{{text-0}}`).

If your button should trigger a [workflow](/workflows/overview/), select the **Trigger Workflow** radio button. This will display one required input field:

* **Workflow Virtual Button**: In order to trigger a workflow, you must have at least one workflow within the selected application, and at least one [virtual button](/workflows/triggers/virtual-button/) within that workflow. This input will display all virtual buttons across all of the application's workflows, from which one must be selected to trigger when the button is pressed.

![Select Virtual Button](/images/dashboards/input-controls-trigger-workflow.png "Select Virtual Button")

### Help Blocks

The Help Block is a special component in the Input Controls Block that allows text to be displayed to users for the purpose of explaining, in greater detail than can be conveyed in a button label, what exactly will happen when a button is pressed and a workflow / device command is fired off.

![Help Block Input](/images/dashboards/input-controls-help-input.png "Help Block Input")

The component has only one input: a textarea in which arbitrary text and [string template](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#string-templates) referencing values by Template ID can be entered. These values will update as the user changes input values in the other components.

![Help Block Example](/images/dashboards/input-controls-help-example.png "Help Block Example")

The textarea also supports <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax" target="\_blank">Markdown</a>, meaning that links, text formatting and even images can also be displayed within the Help Block.

The Help Block is the only Input Controls component whose height can be adjusted – up to four times a normal component's height.

## Constructing Payloads

Device commands and workflow triggers may optionally be sent with a JSON payload, constructed as a [JSON template](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#json-templates). It is the purpose of the input controls to help you construct the payload quickly and easily from the dashboard.

When constructing the [JSON template](/workflows/accessing-payload-data/#json-templates), the values of the other inputs are referenced by their Template ID. For example, given the following configuration ...

![Lights Example](/images/dashboards/input-controls-lights-example.png "Lights Example")

On press of the button, "My First Device" will receive a command named "setColor", with the following payload:

```json
{
  "brightness": 70,
  "enabled": true,
  "foregroundColor": "rgb(125, 50, 75)",
  "backgroundColor": "#f0f0f0",
  "source": "dashboard"
}
```

`brightness` is passed as a number and `enabled` is passed as a boolean, whereas the R, G, and B values are passed as part of a string since the `foregroundColor` property's value is wrapped in double quotes. There is also a static property of `source` being passed in the payload, and since we are not assigning any Template ID to its value, the property will always be submitted with a value of `"dashboard"`.

**Note:** If you do not define a payload for a Trigger Workflow button, the virtual button's default payload – as set within that button's parent workflow – will be sent when your dashboard button is clicked. If you wish to send a blank payload instead of the default payload, set the payload value to `{}` (opening and closing curly braces with nothing in between).

## Locked vs. Unlocked

In order to send commands or trigger workflows, you must first switch the Input Controls block from "Locked" to "Unlocked".

In the block configuration, you have the option of setting the default mode of the block; this is the mode the block will be in when first displayed to the user.

![Locked](/images/dashboards/input-controls-view-mode.png "Locked")

**When in "Locked Mode" ...**

* Controls with dynamic default values will update as your dashboard data refreshes
* Buttons and controls are disabled, preventing user interaction. This is to ensure that a stray mouse press does not trigger an unintentional action.

![Unlocked](/images/dashboards/input-controls-edit-mode.png "Unlocked")

**When in "Unlocked Mode" ...**

* Controls with dynamic defaults cease to update with dashboard data refreshes. (Dynamic default indicators in the control labels will disappear to indicate this.) This holds true until the block is put back into "Locked Mode".
* Buttons can be pressed and controls can be adjusted, thereby allowing commands to be sent to devices and workflows to be triggered.
* If the default mode of the block is "Unlocked", dynamic defaults will load once, on the initial dashboard load.

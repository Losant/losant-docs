# Resource Limits

Organizations and Sandboxes within the Losant Platform are subject to limits on the number of resources (e.g. [devices](/devices/overview/), [applications](/applications/overview/) and more) that are registered under that entity.

## Viewing Current Usage

![Organization Current Usage](/images/organizations/organization-current-usage.png "Organization Current Usage")

To view an **organization's current payload usage**, first navigation to the organization's overview page. There is a widget in the right column that displays the device and payload count for the current period, along with a link to a detailed usage breakdown. That view can also be reached from the organization's `Settings` section, under the `Usage` sub-tab in the left column.

An **organization's past payload usage** can be viewed on each pay period's invoice. Navigate to the `Settings` section, then the `Invoices` sub-tab, and finally choose an invoice to view the usage during that period.

Your **[Sandbox](/user-accounts/sandbox/) usage for the current period** is visible on the Sandbox page, which can be accessed in the top menu by clicking the `Organizations` tab and selecting the `My Sandbox` link. You may only view the Sandbox usage for the current period; historical Sandbox usage is not available at this time.

Though limits do not directly apply to [applications](/applications/overview/), an **application's current usage** can be viewed on the application's overview page. This can, for example, help users determine which of their applications is generating large numbers of payloads and make adjustments to stay within your usage limits.

## Hard-Limited Resources

The following resources limits are strictly enforced. It is not possible to create additional resources within a Sandbox or organization without upgrading:

* **Devices** - This includes all [device types](/devices/overview/#device-type), regardless of whether they connect to the Losant Platform
* **Experience Users** - This covers all [experience users](/experiences/users/) that exist within the owned applications
* **Organization members** - This includes current members (regardless of their role) and pending - but not expired - invitations
* **Data Table storage** - This is amount of data (in bytes) that can be stored across all of the account's data tables

### Message Throttling

Incoming and outgoing messages are each limited to **30 messages in a 15-second window** (or, on average, two per second). If you exceed this limit, the device generating the messages is automatically disconnected.

An **incoming message** is typically a device reporting its state, and an **outgoing message** is usually a command being sent to a device.

For example, if one command is sent to 50 devices, the command only counts as one outgoing message against the message throttling limit, but it counts as 50 payloads against the payload limit.

[Gateway devices](/devices/gateways-peripherals/#gateways) are an exception to the message throttling rule, since they are responsible for all communication between the Losant Platform and their [peripheral devices](/devices/gateways-peripherals/#peripherals). For gateways, the message throttling limit is applied on a per-peripheral basis, meaning the throttling limit is applied individually to each peripheral.

## Payload Limits

For Sandboxes, the number of payloads generated by your applications is a **hard limit**, in that once the limit has been exceeded for the period, any payloads sent to or generated by the platform will be rejected. If you reach this limit, your options are to:

* Create a new [organization](/organizations/overview/) and transfer some (or all) of your Sandbox resources into it
* Transfer some (or all) of your Sandbox resources into an existing organization for which you have [administrator permissions](/organizations/members/)
* Adjust your applications so that they generate fewer payloads, and wait for the payload period to turn over. Your payloads will continue to be rejected until the new period begins.

For organizations, the Losant Platform will continue to accept payloads after you have reached your monthly limit. However, payloads over that limit come with an additional cost.

For current organization and Sandbox usage details, we also supply a message indicating if you are on pace to exceed that period's payload limit. This is based on the number of payloads per second generated during the period extrapolated over the course of the entire period. Therefore, if your payload usage dramatically changes, it may take some time before the changes are reflected in the prognosis.

### Payload Types

We also supply a detailed breakdown of the number of payloads by type so that you can see where the majority of your payloads are accruing and make adjustments to your applications if necessary.

**The following interactions count as a payload:**

* A device reporting its [state](/devices/state/)
* A [command](/devices/commands/) sent to a device
* Device connections to and disconnections from the [Losant broker](/mqtt/overview/#the-losant-message-broker) or via the REST API
* Workflow [timer triggers](/workflows/triggers/timer/)
* Incoming [webhook](/applications/webhooks/) requests
* Incoming [experience endpoint](/experiences/endpoints/) requests
* Incoming [integration](/applications/integrations/) messages
* Workflow virtual buttons presses, including those triggered by an [Input Controls](/dashboards/input-controls/) block
* MQTT inbound and outbound messages (other than those listed above)

**These interactions do NOT count as a payload:**

* Losant [event](/applications/events/) creations and modifications
* [Data requests](/rest-api/data/), including those made by Losant dashboards and [device data exports](/devices/overview/)
* [Webhook replies](/workflows/outputs/webhook-reply/) in workflows
* Workflow runs triggered by another workflow
* [Data table](/data-tables/overview/) row insertions, deletions, edits and queries

## Data Retention

[Device state](/devices/state/), [device connection logs](/devices/overview/#connection-status), and [workflow logs](/rest-api/flow/#get-log-entries) within an application are subject to data retention age limits. Once data is older than the data retention limit, it is deleted. The data retention limit for an application varies depending on your platform license (or if the application is within a user's sandbox). If you need longer term data retention, [contact us](https://www.losant.com/contact-us) for an enterprise plan with customized data retention limits.

## Soft-Limited Resources

Other resources within the Losant Platform are subject to "soft limits." Though organizations and Sandboxes are subject to these limits when creating or transferring resources, you may request increases to these limits at no additional charge.

Soft-limited resources include:

* [Access Keys](/applications/access-keys/)
* [Application API Tokens](/applications/application-tokens/)
* [Applications](/applications/overview/)
* [Dashboards](/dashboards/overview/)
* [Data Tables](/data-tables/overview/)
* [Device Recipes](/devices/device-recipes/)
* [Experience Endpoints](/experiences/endpoints/)
* [Experience Groups](/experiences/groups/)
* [Experience Views](/experiences/views/)
* [Integrations](/applications/integrations/)
* [Webhooks](/applications/webhooks/)
* [Workflows](/workflows/overview/)

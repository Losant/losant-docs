# Losant IoT Developer Kits

*We’ve officially closed the Losant store and have deprecated our Losant kits. The good news is that you can still find components to create your own kits through other suppliers; we’d recommend [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3314). We’re spending more time polishing our platform, and as hardware continues to evolve, we’ll admit we’re not the best source for securing developer kits. You can still find instructions on how to use existing kits in the documentation section of our website. And though we will no longer provide support for individual kit questions, there is a ton of information in the Losant [forums](https://forums.losant.com/).*

The Losant IoT Developer Kits provide all of the hardware and software required to build simple connected devices.
